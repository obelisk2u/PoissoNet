    "# ðŸŒ€ PoissoNet: Pressure Field Approximation with Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook walks through the data generation process for **PoissoNet**, a project focused on learning fast approximations of pressure fields in 2D incompressible fluid flow using neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "We generate synthetic CFD data by solving the pressure Poisson equation on a 2D grid with various obstacle geometries, and store the resulting pressure and RHS fields in `.npz` files for model training."
